              The name 'YONA' is a union of the two words 'Yoga' and
              'Naturopathy'. YONA is a Wellness and Wellbeing Company that
              focuses primarily on fixing lifestyle disorders and general
              wellness for physical, mental and spiritual health. Providing a
              safe space for all age groups that seek the need for alternative
              and drugless healthcare treatments and therapies.Here at YONA we
              aim to provide drug free treatments in a world of cortisol induced
              problems. Yoga is synonymous with healthy way of natural living
              through Yogic Asanas, Pranayama, procedures providing healthy
              living and permanent remedy to various ailments very well
              interwoven with other systems of healings. Naturopathy has been
              greatly advocated by Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi. He practiced
              and preached Nature Cure as the "Answer for Mother India", best
              suitable for India, based on its geographical, cultural, social
              and economic conditions. Nature Cure is a system of man living in
              harmony with constructive principles of Nature on the physical,
              mental and moral planes of human beings. The balance of these
              elements is health and its imbalance is ill-health. Naturopathy
              seeks to encompass all the drugless therapies (with proven &
              empirical basis) and seeks to present to the human beings as an
              option of total health care without any chemical or herbal
              medicines. This is especially relevant in the present times with
              the rise of life style diseases to almost epidemic proportions and
              that to despite the advancements in modern science and super
              specialty care.
